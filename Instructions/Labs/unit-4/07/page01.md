# Lesson 7: Optimizing Inventory with Logistics Data: A Supply Chain Simulation

## Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will learn how delays in shipments can affect a factory’s 
production. They will use real data and Azure ML Designer to create a model that predicts 
whether a shipment will arrive on time or be delayed. The goal is to show how predicting 
delays can help make smarter decisions to keep production running smoothly.

## Main Learning Goal:
Students will analyze a manufacturing logistics dataset to identify delivery delays and build 
a classification model using Azure ML Designer. They will explore how machine learning 
supports inventory planning and improves supply chain decision-making.

## Essential Question:
How can data about shipping, distance, and delivery delays help a manufacturing 
company predict inventory needs more effectively?

## Standards:
• Standard 4.4: Evaluate the use of a large data set to explore a real-world scenario 
  → Students use Azure ML Designer to uncover shipment patterns and train a model to classify on-time vs delayed shipments.

## Objectives:
• Interpret and describe key fields in a logistics dataset. 
• Use Azure ML Designer to clean, analyze, and visualize delivery data. 
• Build and evaluate a two-class classification model to predict shipment delays. 
• Use predictions to make data-driven inventory planning recommendations
