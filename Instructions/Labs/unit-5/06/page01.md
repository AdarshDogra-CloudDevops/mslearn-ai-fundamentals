# Hands-On-Lab: Training, Validation, and Testing Data in Sports Analytics

In this hands-on lab, you will build and evaluate a machine learning pipeline using Azure ML Designer to predict basketball players’ points per game. You'll explore how different train/test split ratios affect model performance by experimenting with 70/30, 90/10, and 60/40 partitions. As you train and evaluate the model, you'll gain an understanding of how training data size influences learning accuracy and the model's ability to generalize. This lab provides practical experience in model training, pipeline execution, and performance evaluation within a sports analytics context.

## Lab Objectives
