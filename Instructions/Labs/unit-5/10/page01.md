# Lesson 10: Troubleshooting in Azure ML Designer
## Lesson Description:

In this lesson, students will take on the role of junior data scientists working for a South 
Carolina sports analytics team. They will investigate a faulty Azure ML pipeline filled with 
common configuration errors. Through a hands-on lab, students will identify problems, 
interpret error messages, and fix them step-by-step to restore functionality and continue 
model development.

## Main Learning Goal:

Students will learn to identify and fix common Azure ML Designer pipeline errors through 
error message interpretation and structured troubleshooting steps.
Essential Question:
How can you identify and fix problems in a machine learning pipeline when things go 
wrong?

## Standards:

- CS1.1 – Utilize a common troubleshooting process to identify software problems 
that involve the interpretation of error messages and common system malfunctions

## Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 

- Recognize a variety of Azure ML Designer pipeline errors.
- Interpret error messages and connect them to specific modules or data steps. 
- Apply a structured troubleshooting process to fix broken or misconfigured 
pipelines. 
- Explain how error resolution improves the reliability of AI-based workflows.


## Fix the Pipeline Before the Deadline (15 Minutes)
## Real-World Scenario 
You are back in your role as a junior analyst for a South Carolina scouting board. You have 
just been handed a predictive model in Azure ML Designer that is supposed to estimate 
how many points a player will score—but the pipeline is broken. It will not run. You need to 
fix it before the scout meeting later today.

Now answer these questions: 

- **Q1: If you saw an error while running a machine learning pipeline, what would 
you do first?**

- **Q2: Have you ever seen an error message in Azure before?**

In today’s lesson, you will become a real ML troubleshooter—someone who can read error 
messages, figure out where things went wrong, and fix them. These skills are essential in 
real AI careers and future projects

## The Goal

Machine learning pipelines do not always work the first time—and that is okay. Every 
professional ML engineer needs to know how to fix failures. Today, you will explore the 
most common Azure ML Designer errors and learn how to fix each one with confidence.

### Quick Troubleshooting Framework

Consider this short mindset tool you will use throughout the lesson:

When you see an error in Azure ML Designer, here’s a simple way to figure it out:

- Read the error message carefully
  Look for key words like label, input, or disconnected
- Find the module that is causing the issue
  Use the red X in the canvas or look at the message panel
- Try one fix at a time
  Do not guess—test a solution, re-run, and see what changes
  
You’ll use this same process to solve each of the errors we work on today.
