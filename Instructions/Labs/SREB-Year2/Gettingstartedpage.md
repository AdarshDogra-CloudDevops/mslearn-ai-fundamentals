### Notes:

- You will be assigned a dedicated hands-on environment. The Azure credit consumption includes all the resources which you will be deploying while using the lab environment for your testing.

- You will have Contributor privilege access on the Azure subscription, you can freely explore the features of required services and are recommended to use it only for testing purposes.

- The environment has a fixed budget/cap of $100 USD, kindly do not deploy any other resources that are not related to the testing as they can consume the Azure credit leading to the automatic deallocation of the environment as soon as the credit limit is reached.

### Cost Monitoring:
To monitor and analyse your Azure credit spend, you can navigate to the Azure Subscription page by following the steps mentioned below.

1. On your virtual machine, click on the **Azure Portal** icon as shown below:
