## Becoming a Confident Debugger (15 Minutes)

In this phase, you will shift from fixing errors to understanding and explaining the reasoning behind each step they took. The goal is to help you internalize a repeatable process for solving problems in Azure ML Designer and build confidence in applying it independently.

### Review the Troubleshooting Process

Let’s briefly recap the structured debugging steps we used throughout the Explore activity. Consider the following point

How to Troubleshoot in Azure ML Designer:

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check flow and input connections between modules
3. Preview the data at key points (e.g., after Split or Score)
4. Open Job Overview → expand Child Jobs → check the Status
5. Review error_info.json and std_log.txt in Outputs + Logs
6. Rerun modules if the pipeline used cached values
7. Reflect on what was fixed — and why it worked
   
This process applies to any problem — even those they have not seen before.

### Debugging Self-Reflection (Quick Write)

Please, respond to these questions individually:
- Q1: Which error took you the longest to solve, and what finally helped you fix it?
- Q2: What tools or features in Azure helped you the most today?
- Q3: How would you explain your troubleshooting process to someone new to ML Designer?
  
You can respond on paper, in a digital form, or in your notebooks. This promotes personal clarity and prepares you for upcoming lessons that require independent debugging.

### My Debugging Playbook

Create a summary that you can revisit later. Complete these sentence starters:

- “When I see an error in Azure, the first thing I’ll check is…”
- “Job Overview and logs help me because they…”
- “The most useful habit I developed today was…”
  
You will be able to distill your own thinking into strategies you can use in future modeling
