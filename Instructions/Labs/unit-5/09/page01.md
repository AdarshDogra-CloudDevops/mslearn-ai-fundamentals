# Lesson 9: Algorithm Components

## Lesson Description:

In this lesson, students will explore the fundamental control structures used in computer 
and machine learning programs. These include sequencing, selection, iteration, and 
recursion, key components used to build algorithms. Students will experience each 
component through guided examples and live demonstrations, then apply what they learn 
to their final projects.

## Main Learning Goal:

Students will understand and utilize the fundamental control structures, iteration, 
selection, sequencing, and recursion, that form the foundation of algorithms.

## Essential Question:
How do iteration, selection, sequencing, and recursion shape the way programs make 
decisions and solve problems?

## Standards:

- AP6.1 - Design, build, and test level-appropriate algorithms that use iteration 
selection, sequencing, and recursion.

## Objectives:

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Define and explain iteration, selection, sequencing, and recursion
- Identify real-world and programmatic examples of each component
- Follow and participate in guided demonstrations of each component
  - Explain how these components are used to build the algorithms behind their final project and how they contribute to the overall structure of the program

## Bits and Pieces
Algorithms are the foundation of all computer programs; they help us perform tasks 
efficiently and systematically.

An algorithm is a set of instructions that is designed to accomplish a task. Algorithms 
usually take one or more inputs, run them systematically through a series of steps, and 
provide one or more outputs.

But what makes up an algorithm? Like a good recipe, algorithms are built from key 
components. In programming and machine learning, the four fundamental building blocks 
of algorithms are sequencing, selection, iteration, and recursion. These components 
define how data flows, how decisions are made, and how problems are broken down stepby-step.
