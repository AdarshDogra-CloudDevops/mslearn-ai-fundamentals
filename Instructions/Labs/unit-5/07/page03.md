## Now take some time to examine your results, then answer the following questions on your SREB_U5_L7_Handout.

a. Q1: How well did your supervised model perform?

   Provide the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. 

b. Q2: How many data points were assigned to each cluster in your unsupervised model? 

c. Q3: Since it is up to the human analyst to interpret the clusters, examine the characteristics of each group. What trends do you notice? How would you label each cluster, Elite, Average, or Poor, based on the data? 

d. Q4: What are some ways the performance of your supervised or unsupervised models could be improved? 

e. Q5: How can both classification and clustering be useful in sports analytics?

Provide examples of when each would be valuable.

## Exit Pass

As we wrap up today’s lesson, take a moment to complete the exit pass questions on your SREB_U5_L7_Handout. These reflections will help you connect what you learned about 
classification and clustering to your upcoming final project.

- Q1: Is one approach, classification, or clustering better than the other? Why or why not?

- Q2: How might you use either classification or clustering to strengthen your final project
