# Hands-On-Lab: Algorithms in Action

In this hands-on lab, you will work with core control structures such as sequencing, selection, iteration, and recursion—building blocks of computer and machine learning programs. Through guided exercises and interactive examples, you will observe how each control structure functions within an algorithm. You will then apply these concepts to create simple logic flows, helping you build a strong foundation for developing your own machine learning or programming projects.
