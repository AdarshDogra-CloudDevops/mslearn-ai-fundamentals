# Final Instructions:

After each run, go to the **Evaluate Model** module.

Visualize the output and record:

- Accuracy
- False Positives (model predicted shutdown, but it was not needed)
- False Negatives (model missed a shutdown when it should have occurred)
- 
Write a short observation for each run:

- Q1: What changed and why?
