# Lesson 13: Classifying Players Using Decision Trees

## Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will act as basketball scouting analysts and use real-world South Carolina sports data to classify players as starters or non-starters. They will build a decision tree classification model using Azure ML Designer and learn how the model “splits” data to make predictions. Students will select features, build a model using the Two-Class Decision Forest module, and interpret the model’s accuracy and decision process using Azure’s built-in evaluation tools.

## Main Learning Goal:
Students will use Azure ML Designer to train and evaluate a decision tree classifier and 
analyze how the model splits input features to predict player categories.

### Essential Question:
How can a decision tree help us recognize patterns in sports data and make accurate 
classification decisions?

### Standards:
- AP6.2 – Use decision trees and linear regression to make predictions and classifications. (Note: Linear regression is addressed in Lesson 11; this lesson focuses on decision 
tree classification)

### Objectives:

- Select relevant features from a dataset to train a classification model
- Use Azure ML Designer to build a decision tree pipeline
- Predict player classifications (starter vs. non-starter) using model output
- Evaluate model performance using Azure's scoring and evaluation tools
- Reflect on how the model splits input data and makes decisions
