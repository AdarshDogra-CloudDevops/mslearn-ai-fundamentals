# Automated Machine learning using AML


### Overall Estimated timing: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you'll explore Azure Machine Learning's capabilities by creating a workspace, setting up compute resources, and creating a dataset. You'll run an automated machine learning job to train and identify the best model, then deploy it as a predictive service. Finally, you'll test the deployed service to ensure it delivers accurate results. This lab will demonstrate how Azure Machine Learning can streamline your workflow and enhance productivity.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a workspace in Azure Machine Learning, use automated machine learning to train a predictive model, and deploy the model as a web service.

1. **Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace**: You will learn how to set up and configure an Azure Machine Learning workspace, which is the foundation for managing your machine learning resources and experiments.

2. **Run and Review Automated Machine Learning Jobs:** Understand how to train multiple models, identify the best one, and review its performance. Deploy and Test Predictive Services: Gain the ability to deploy models as predictive services and test them to ensure they deliver accurate results.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts and workflows.
- Basic knowledge of data preparation and processing techniques.

## Architecture

This architecture flow demonstrates how various Azure components work together to handle, process, analyze, and visualize data, providing a comprehensive and intelligent system tailored to business needs. You’ll start by creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace to manage resources, followed by provisioning compute resources for experiments. Next, you’ll create and register datasets, run automated machine learning jobs to identify the best model, and review model performance. The best model is then deployed as a predictive service, which is tested to ensure accuracy. This integrated approach showcases Azure’s AI and data analysis capabilities, enhancing productivity and delivering personalized experiences.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure OpenAI**: This component provides access to advanced AI models from OpenAI, enabling natural language processing and other AI capabilities in applications.
- **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**: Central hub for managing machine learning resources like datasets, experiments, and models. It supports collaboration and tracks the entire ML lifecycle.
- **Compute Cluster**: A group of interconnected computers that distribute and speed up machine learning tasks. It scales dynamically based on workload.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The output of the ML process, representing learned patterns from data. It is used to make predictions or decisions based on new data.
