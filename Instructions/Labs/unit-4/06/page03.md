# Summary
In this lesson, we took on the role of quality analysts at a factory, using Azure ML Designer to train a model that spots unhappy customers based on their feedback. We built a TwoClass Logistic Regression model and looked at how well it worked using tools like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. At the end, we wrote a memo 
explaining our results to factory leaders.

This hands-on activity connects directly to our final project. It helped us:

- Learn how to use AI to understand real-world data like customer comments
- Think about what it means when a model makes a mistake (false positives and false negatives)
- Practice explaining technical results to non-technical people
- Defend the choices we make when building and using AI tools
  
By doing this, we’re better prepared to design our own AI solution for improving a part of the manufacturing process. We now understand how data from customer feedback can lead to smarter business decisions—something we’ll need to think about in our final project.

## Exit Ticket

To close out today’s lesson, you will complete a short exit ticket (individually), to reflect on what you learned.

Think back on the activity, the Sentiment Classification you did and the model you created, and the kinds of feedback you explored. Then, take a few minutes to respond to the questions below:

1. Why is analyzing text feedback useful in a manufacturing business?
  
1. What did your model learn to look for when detecting dissatisfaction?
   
1. If you were in charge of improving one product, what feedback would guide you?

1. Would you rather read 1,000 reviews manually or let a model help you find patterns? Why?
