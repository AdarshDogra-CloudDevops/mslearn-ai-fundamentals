# Lesson 8: Exploring AI libraries and Tools 

## Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore software libraries and platforms used in artificial intelligence and machine learning, focusing on tools available in Python and Azure ML 
Studio. 

Using the Clemson Tigers Football School History dataset, students will develop a simple 
regression model to predict team performance metrics. They will implement this model 
using both code-based and no-code environments — specifically, Jupyter Notebooks 
(Python with scikit-learn) and Azure ML Studio Designer. 

This hands-on comparison helps students understand how the same machine learning 
task can be performed in different environments and supports critical thinking about tool 
selection based on project needs and data context.

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will explore and utilize AI and machine learning libraries in Python and Azure ML 
Studio and reflect on the strengths of each platform in performing data-driven tasks on 
real-world sports data.

### Essential Question:
Which libraries and platforms are used to develop machine learning models, and how do 
we determine the right one for our project?

### Standards:
- CS1.2 – Identify applications, libraries, and software packages utilized within AI and machine learning industries.

### Objectives:
- Identify key Python-based libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) and cloud-based tools (e.g., Azure ML Studio Designer).
- Implement and evaluate a machine learning regression model in both code-based and no-code environments.
- Use the Clemson Tigers School History dataset to explore model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- Reflect on how different platforms (e.g., Jupyter vs. Azure) approach the same task and determine which is best suited for their goals.
