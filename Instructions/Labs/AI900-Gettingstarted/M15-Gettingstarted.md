# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 15: Explore Azure AI Translator

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

This lab will help you explore the capabilities of Azure AI Translator, a service that simplifies language translation across applications. The Azure AI Translator service can detect and translate languages, making it easier to build multilingual solutions for websites, mobile apps, and other services. You will set up a Translator resource and explore how the service works within the Azure Portal.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

1. Create a Translator resource in the Azure Portal.

2. Explore the core features of Azure AI Translator including text translation, language detection, and language support.

## Pre-requisites

Familiarity with language translation use cases in applications.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Azure Portal**: The platform where you will create and manage the Translator resource.

2. **Translator Resource**: The service deployed in Azure that provides text translation and language detection.

3. **API Requests**: Interactions with the Translator service using API calls to translate text or detect languages.
