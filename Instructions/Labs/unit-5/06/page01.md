# Hands-On-Lab: Training, Validation, and Testing Data in Sports Analytics

In this hands-on lab, you will build a machine learning pipeline in Azure ML Designer to predict a basketball player’s points per game (PTS). You will experiment with different train/test split ratios—70/30, 90/10, and 60/40—to observe how data partitioning impacts model performance. By comparing the results, you'll gain insights into the effect of training data size on learning accuracy and generalization.
