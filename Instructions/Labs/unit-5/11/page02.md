# Hands-On-Lab: Regression in Azure ML Designer

In this hands-on lab, you will take on the role of a junior sports analyst to predict player performance for a South Carolina basketball team. Using Azure ML Designer, you will build and compare Linear Regression and Boosted Decision Tree models based on player statistics. You’ll experiment with feature selection, evaluate model accuracy using RMSE and R², and interpret the results. Based on predicted outcomes, you’ll make data-driven scouting recommendations.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Set Up the Azure ML Workspace

- Task 5: Run the Pipeline and Submit the Job
- Task 6: Model Evaluation Results (Azure ML Designer)
- Task 7: Swap in Boosted Decision Tree Regression
