After each run, evaluate the model and record your results for comparison.

Use your table provided in your `SREB_U5_L6_Handout` to decide which split gives the best balance between learning and fair testing.

## Why This Matters

This process helps you see how data division affects model learning and fairness. A larger training set may improve learning, but a smaller test set reduces the ability to evaluate. A balanced split provides a more honest test of model performance.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to compare models built with different splits and explain which one you would trust to make real predictions—just like a real analyst would do when recommending players to a coach
