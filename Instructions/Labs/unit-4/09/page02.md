# Hands-On-Lab: Training Makes It Smarter – Understanding the Role of Data in Machine Learning

In this hands-on lab, you will collect real sensor data from your Arduino-based robot and use it to train a machine learning model in Azure. You will prepare and clean the dataset, paying close attention to issues such as low data volume or corrupted sensor readings. By experimenting with different data conditions, you will observe how these factors affect model accuracy and performance. Throughout the lab, you will follow a structured workflow that emphasizes data preparation, model training, and evaluation—providing a practical, project-based experience in building reliable machine learning solutions.
