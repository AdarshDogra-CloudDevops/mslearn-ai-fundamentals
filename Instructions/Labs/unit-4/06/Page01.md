# Lesson 6: Analyzing Manufacturing Feedback with Text Data
Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore how manufacturers use customer feedback from 
surveys, warranty claims, and product reviews to identify issues and improve product 
quality. Students will process and analyze real-world textual feedback using a machine 
learning pipeline to predict customer satisfaction and discover patterns such as common 
defects or complaints. 
Main Learning Goal:
Students will explore how manufacturers use customer feedback from surveys or forms to 
identify improvement areas. They will process and analyze real-world textual data using a 
machine learning pipeline in Azure ML Designer to predict customer satisfaction and 
discover patterns.
Essential Question:
How can manufacturers use customer feedback data to improve products, services, and 
customer satisfaction? 
Standards:
• 4.4: Evaluate the use of a large data set to explore a real-world scenario. 
• 3.4: Justify the choice of data collection method, data analysis tool, and data 
representation tool.
Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
• Explain how manufacturers collect and use text-based feedback. 
• Clean and process customer feedback using Text Preprocessing in Azure ML 
Designer. 
• Convert text into numerical form using Extract N-Gram Features from Text. 
• Train a classification model to predict satisfaction levels. 
• Evaluate model results using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. 
• Reflect on the business value of analyzing large volumes of feedback.
