# L7 Lesson Plan: Supervised vs Unsupervised Categorization

## Lesson Description:

In this lesson, students will explore machine learning algorithms used for classification 
and clustering, gaining a deeper understanding of how models can learn patterns and 
make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. They will practice building 
both supervised and unsupervised models and compare the outcomes to see how 
different approaches can be used to categorize information.

## Main Learning Goal:
Students will learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to apply both supervised and 
unsupervised learning techniques to solve a categorization task. 
Essential Question:
How can Azure Machine Learning be used to apply different methods of classification and 
prediction to analyze and interpret data effectively? 

## Standards:

- AP6.1 - Describe and use the types of algorithms used for classification. 
- AP6.1 - Identify machine learning techniques that allow the computer to learn 
behaviors without explicit programming.

## Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
- Use Azure Machine Learning to build and run both supervised and unsupervised 
models for classification tasks.
- Understand the differences between classification and clustering approaches. 
- Analyze and compare the results of each model to evaluate their effectiveness. 
- Identify which type of learning is better suited for specific types of data or problems.

## Categorizing Categorization

Let's begin the lesson by answering the questions on page 1 of the SREB_U5_L7_Handout
and sharing our answers with the class.

-  **Q1: How do we categorize things in our daily lives?**

We often sort objects, people, or situations into groups based on shared characteristics, 
whether it is separating clothing by color, organizing music by genre, or deciding what 
makes an athlete elite.

We have previously discussed supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and now 
we will take a moment to review what they mean.

- Please, try to define supervised and unsupervised machine learning in your own 
words.

Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained 
using labeled data (with correct answers). Common supervised models include:

- Logistic regression

- Decision tree

- K-nearest neighbors

Unsupervised machine learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning where the 
model finds patterns or groups in data that is not labeled. Common unsupervised models 
include:

- K-means clustering
- Principal component analysis (PCA)

Today, we will focus on categorization tasks, using both supervised and unsupervised 
models in Azure to explore how machines can group athletes or sports data.

Before jumping into the Azure demonstration, answer the following question in your 
SREB_U5_L7_Handout and share your thoughts.

- Q1: How do you think categorization is used in sports analytics?

Examples may include:

- Grouping athletes by playing style or performance metrics.
- Predicting player positions based on stats.
- Clustering similar game strategies.
