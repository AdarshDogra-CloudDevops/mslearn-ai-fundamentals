Lesson 2: Sports Data
Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore the types of data needed for sports and predictive 
analytics. They will learn the importance of preprocessing raw data to make it usable for 
analysis. Students will then apply these skills by working with a dataset in Azure, using 
Azure tools to clean, organize, store, and visualize their data.
Main Learning Goal:
Students will understand how to preprocess and organize data using tools like Azure to 
prepare it for predictive analytics in sports. 
Essential Question:
How do we transform raw data, using tools like Azure, to make data useable for sports 
analytics?
