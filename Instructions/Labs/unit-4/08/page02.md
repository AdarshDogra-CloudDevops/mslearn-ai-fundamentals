# Hands-On-Lab: Spot the Flaw - Detecting Defective Products with Image Classification

In this hands-on lab, you will explore how artificial intelligence can support quality control in manufacturing by detecting defective parts. You will work with real product images, train a machine learning model using Azure Custom Vision, and evaluate its accuracy and performance. Through guided activities, you will also reflect on when to trust a model’s predictions and how combining multiple data sources can enhance reliability and safety in automated systems.
