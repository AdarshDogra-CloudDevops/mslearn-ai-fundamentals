# L7 Lesson Plan: Supervised vs Unsupervised Categorization
## Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore machine learning algorithms used for classification 
and clustering, gaining a deeper understanding of how models can learn patterns and 
make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. They will practice building 
both supervised and unsupervised models and compare the outcomes to see how 
different approaches can be used to categorize information.

## Main Learning Goal:
Students will learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to apply both supervised and 
unsupervised learning techniques to solve a categorization task. 
Essential Question:
How can Azure Machine Learning be used to apply different methods of classification and 
prediction to analyze and interpret data effectively? 

## Standards:

- AP6.1 - Describe and use the types of algorithms used for classification. 
- AP6.1 - Identify machine learning techniques that allow the computer to learn 
behaviors without explicit programming.

## Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to: 
- Use Azure Machine Learning to build and run both supervised and unsupervised 
models for classification tasks.
- Understand the differences between classification and clustering approaches. 
- Analyze and compare the results of each model to evaluate their effectiveness. 
- Identify which type of learning is better suited for specific types of data or problems.
