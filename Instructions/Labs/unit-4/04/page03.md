## Custom Visualizations (Using Python Code) 

If you want to go deeper—for example, to: 

- Plot time series of sensor readings 
- Overlay anomaly predictions with machine types 
- Visualize trends over time
- 
You can use a **custom Python script** inside Azure ML Designer. By adding a **"Execute Python Script"** component, you can write code using libraries like:

- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- pandas (for data processing)
  
This gives you more control over how data is visualized and interpreted.

## Advanced Visualization Tools (Power BI)

For interactive dashboards, live filtering, and publishing visuals: 

- You can export your pipeline output to Azure Blob Storage
- Then connect Power BI to this storage
- Create professional-level dashboards to present insights to stakeholders or decision-makers
- 
Power BI is especially useful in industrial settings where teams need **automated reports** or **real-time anomaly tracking**.
